# IgG+ Specimens - Lineage analysis with SONAR

## Initial Processing - IgG+ specimens

In some cases we've sequenced the same physical specimen multiple times, so we 
combine these replicates for analysis (this way deduplication and such works
across replicates).

```{r}
drawtab(counts_by_amplicon)
```

## pRESTO processing

pRESTO pairs forward and reverse reads, applies a quality filter, and checks for
the expected primer sequence at the start of the amplicons.  We can the sequence
counts as compared with the cell counts through each step.

```{r}
drawtab(subset(counts_presto, select = -c(Subject, Timepoint, Chain, ChainType)))
```
