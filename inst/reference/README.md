# Reference Sequences from Elsewhere

 * `10.1016_j.cell.2019.06.030`: Rhesus antibody alleles from
   <http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.06.030>.  I gathered these while looking
   for the sequence `IGHV4-ABB-S*01_S8200` and before trying IgDiscover myself.
   These shouldn't be needed any longer, I think.
 * `imgt`: Rhesus macaque reference allele sequences from
   [IMGT](http://www.imgt.org/vquest/refseqh.html).  Likewise we should no
   longer need these as we have newer rhesus alleles from the Ramesh et al.  paper
   via [SONAR](https://github.com/scharch/SONAR/tree/master/germDB) in the `BU_DD`
   files.
